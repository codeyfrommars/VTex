\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Even in the modern era, mathematical work is often done by hand. However, modern technology requires digital typesetting for ease of reading. \LaTeX\ is a tool to put mathematical equations on paper, but its code is tedious and impractical to use to jot down rapid thoughts. Despite this, all substantial math must be translated to \LaTeX\ before publishing. Our project aims to bridge the gap between brainstorming and printing, translating images of equations directly to \LaTeX\ code. While others have attempted this before with various results\cite{Peng, Genthial, Wang, Wang02}, to our knowledge, none have implemented a full app pipeline that works with handwritten equations.
