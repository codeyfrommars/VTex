    Optical character recognition (OCR) is a rapidly developing area of research with many practical applications in the digital era. One such lucrative application is converting handwritten mathematical work into \LaTeX\ code. In this paper, we implement a neural network model to convert images to \LaTeX\ code, comparing the results with other state of the art models. In addition, a full framework is proposed for an app that allows the user to draw equations in the air using an RGB webcam and have those drawings converted to \LaTeX\ code automatically.
