\section{Justification for Five Members}
\label{sec:justification}
In this project, we aim to develop a full app pipeline that consists of multiple computer vision applications. For this reason, we have split the project into two subprojects: one for \LaTeX\ OCR and one for air drawing. While majority of our efforts will be dedicated to getting good results with a neural network, some members will simultaneously be developing an app with hand tracking interaction. Hopefully, we will have a full minimal viable product that can be presented for the final presentation. For this reason, we believe the ambition of this project requires five team members.
