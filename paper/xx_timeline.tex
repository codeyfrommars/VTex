\section{Timeline}
\label{sec:timeline}

All members will be responsible for the \LaTeX\ OCR portion. 1-2 members will work on the virtual drawing application. It is highly likely that both parts will not be finished in the given time frame, so our research efforts will be focused on OCR. Week 1 is the week of Oct. 16.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Weeks 1-2: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Design a neural network model
            \item Get familiar with PyTorch
            \item Download MediaPipe and implement hand tracking
        \end{itemize}
    \item Weeks 3-4:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Develop NN modules
            \item Design gestures to interact with air drawing app
            \item Implement gesture recognition to draw images
        \end{itemize}
    \item Weeks 5-6:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Find/create training sets
            \item Train the NN modules
            \item Begin air drawing app development
        \end{itemize}
    \item Weeks 7-8:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improve the NN with more complex datasets
            \item Integrate the NN with the air drawing app
            \item Write report and prepare presentation
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
