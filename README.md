### Demo

To run the demo, run `bash demo.sh`. It may take a while to create a virtual environment, but the demo should start up automatically.

### Usage

- Draw with your right hand
- Holding up only your index finger will draw
- Holding up both your index and middle finger will pause drawing
- Holding up four fingers on your right hand will take a screenshot and output the LaTeX code to the bash terminal
- Holding up four fingers on your left hand will clear the screen

### Training

To train the model yourself, unzip data2.zip in `/transformer/`. Then, run `train.py` and `test.py`. You may need to modify some of the code to fit your machine.
